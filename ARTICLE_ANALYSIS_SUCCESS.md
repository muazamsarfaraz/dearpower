## 🧪 Live Testing Results

### **Test Case: BBC Vaping Article**
**URL**: https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66784967
**Article Title**: "Why are disposable vapes being banned and how harmful is vaping?"

### **Generated Email Analysis:**
The system successfully extracted and referenced:
- ✅ **Specific Date**: June 1, 2025 ban implementation
- ✅ **Statistics**: 5 million disposable vapes discarded weekly in 2023
- ✅ **Youth Data**: 18% of 11-17 year olds tried vaping, 7% currently vaping
- ✅ **Environmental Impact**: Lithium-ion batteries and toxic chemicals
- ✅ **Policy Details**: Vaping duty introduction and illegal vape crackdowns
- ✅ **Specific Asks**: Enhanced education, recycling programs, enforcement

### **Before vs After Comparison:**

**❌ Before (Generic):**
```
"I am writing about healthcare concerns in our area..."
```

**✅ After (Contextual):**
```
"I am writing to express my concerns regarding the government's upcoming ban 
on disposable vapes, as highlighted in a recent BBC article... The statistic 
that nearly five million single-use vapes were discarded weekly in 2023 
underscores the urgent need for this measure..."
```

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Content Extraction Strategy:**
```javascript
// Smart selector hierarchy
const contentSelectors = [
  'article',           // Semantic HTML5
  'main',             // Main content area
  '.content',         // Common class names
  '.article-content',
  '.post-content',
  '.entry-content',
  '.story-body',      // BBC specific
  '.article-body'     // News sites
];
```

### **Content Processing:**
1. **Fetch**: HTTP request with proper User-Agent
2. **Parse**: Cheerio HTML parsing
3. **Clean**: Remove scripts, ads, navigation
4. **Extract**: Title from multiple sources (h1, title, meta)
5. **Limit**: Content to ~12,000 characters
6. **Format**: Clean whitespace and line breaks

### **Security Features:**
- ✅ URL protocol validation (http/https only)
- ✅ Request timeouts (10 seconds)
- ✅ Content size limits
- ✅ Error boundary protection
