## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Changes:**
```javascript
// User details form section
<div class="personal-details mb-4">
    <h5>Your Details</h5>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <label for="user-full-name">Full Name *</label>
            <input type="text" id="user-full-name" required>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <label for="user-address">Address</label>
            <input type="text" id="user-address" 
                   value="${userData.address}" readonly>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### **Validation Logic:**
```javascript
validateEmailForm() {
    const hasName = nameInput.value.trim().length > 0;
    const hasTopic = this.userData.topic;
    generateBtn.disabled = !(hasName && hasTopic);
}
```

### **Backend Prompt Enhancement:**
```javascript
// Add user details to prompt
if (fullName || address) {
    combinedPrompt += `
User Details to include in the email signature:
- Full Name: ${fullName}
- Address: ${address}

Please replace [Your Name] with "${fullName}" and 
[Your Address] with "${address}" in the email signature.`;
